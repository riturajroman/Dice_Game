Two-Player Dice Game
Overview

This is a simple two-player dice game that you can play with a friend. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a predefined target score by rolling a pair of dice in each turn. Each player takes turns rolling the dice and accumulating points based on the outcomes of their rolls. The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.
Rules

    The game is played between two players, Player 1 and Player 2.

    Each player takes turns to roll a pair of six-sided dice.

    The sum of the values on the two dice is added to the player's current score.

    If a player rolls a 1 on either die, they lose all points accumulated in that turn, and their turn ends.

    The player can choose to "Hold" after any roll, which adds their current turn's score to their total score. It then becomes the other player's turn.

    The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.
